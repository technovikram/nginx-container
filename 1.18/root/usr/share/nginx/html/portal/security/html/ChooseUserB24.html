<strong>User Administration - Choose User</strong>
<p>
The Choose User page gives you access to the User Administration application. Only the tabs and buttons available to your user ID display on this page. If you do not have security access to one of these options you do not see it. This help page reviews all possible options on the Choose User page and may contain items you do not see.
<p>
The tabs at the top of the page&#151;Choose User, Reports, and Defaults&#151;allow you to view and maintain your institution's user security records, view reports, and set default information for the application. 
<p>
The Add User button takes you into the Add Wizard which walks you through each page possible for adding a user security record. 
<p>
In the Search section, you can enter information into one or more of the available fields to search for user records. The Results section displays relevant data based on the search criteria entered. The system retains the search criteria and results on this page when you return to it from within a user security record.
<p>
Please use the buttons and tabs provided in this application for navigation. The Enter key is not a valid option and may give you unexpected results.
