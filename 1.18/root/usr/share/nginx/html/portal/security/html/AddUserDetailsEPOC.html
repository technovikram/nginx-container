<strong>User Administration&#8212;Add User Details</strong>
<p>

The first step in the add user process is to enter basic information relating to the new user&#151;mainly the user's name and address. Some fields on the page default and cannot be changed.
<p>

<strong>Note:</strong> Every institution has one designated primary security administrator. Maximum privileges applicable to the institution are defined on this user's security record. Other administrators and other users can be given the same or lesser privileges. When adding or maintaining a user record, you are not able to give more access than you have. Please refer to the <em>Security </em>manual for further details.<p>Also, if you have chosen the <strong>Copy User</strong> option, most of the information on this page and the subsequent pages is copied from the selected record. This information can be modified as needed for the new user being added.
